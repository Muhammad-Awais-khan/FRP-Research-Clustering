================================================================================
PHASE 6: KEYWORD EXTRACTION AND CLUSTER CHARACTERIZATION
================================================================================

6.1 KEYWORD EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY
------
Purpose:
  - Identify representative terms for each cluster
  - Validate cluster semantic coherence
  - Generate human-interpretable cluster labels
  - Provide evidence for research category assignments

Technique: TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
  - TF-IDF = Term importance measure combining:
    * Term Frequency (TF): Frequency of term in document
    * Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): Rarity of term across corpus
  - High TF-IDF: Terms frequent in specific cluster but rare elsewhere
  - Perfect for identifying distinguishing keywords

Implementation:
  1. Vectorize all abstracts into TF-IDF matrix
  2. For each cluster, aggregate TF-IDF scores
  3. Rank terms by average TF-IDF within cluster
  4. Extract top 10 keywords per cluster

6.2 TF-IDF VECTORIZATION CONFIGURATION
------
Vectorizer Parameters:

  Parameter              Value          Rationale
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  max_features           5,000          Limit vocabulary size
  stop_words             'english'      Remove common English words
  lowercase              True           Normalize text case
  ngram_range            (1,1)          Single words (default)
  min_df                 1              Include rare terms
  max_df                 1.0            No frequency upper bound
  
Vocabulary Size:
  - Initial vocabulary: ~50,000+ unique terms
  - Filtered vocabulary: 5,000 top features
  - Removed: Function words, pronouns, prepositions
  - Retained: Domain-specific technical terms

Output Matrix:
  - Shape: (23,085 documents, 5,000 features)
  - Sparsity: ~99.5% (expected for TF-IDF)
  - Data Type: Float64 (TF-IDF scores)

6.3 CLUSTER-SPECIFIC KEYWORD EXTRACTION
------
Process for Each Cluster:

  1. Identify paper indices belonging to cluster
  2. Extract corresponding rows from TF-IDF matrix
  3. Calculate mean TF-IDF score for each term
  4. Sort terms by mean score (descending)
  5. Select top 10 terms
  6. Store as cluster-specific keyword list

Aggregation Method:
  - Averaging: tf_cluster = mean(tfidf_matrix[cluster_indices])
  - Rationale: Captures terms most consistently important in cluster
  - Alternative (sum): Would bias toward cluster size (rejected)

================================================================================
PHASE 8: DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION AND VISUALIZATION
================================================================================

8.1 VISUALIZATION STRATEGY
------
Purpose:
  - Create 2D representation of 384-dimensional embeddings
  - Visualize cluster separation and quality
  - Enable human interpretation of cluster structure
  - Produce publication-ready figure

Technical Challenge:
  - Original space: 384 dimensions (not directly visualizable)
  - Required: 2D projection maintaining cluster structure
  - Solution: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

8.2 PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS (PCA)
------
PCA Overview:
  - Type: Linear dimensionality reduction technique
  - Goal: Find 2 orthogonal directions explaining maximum variance
  - Variance preserved: ~30-40% of total (typical for 384→2 reduction)
  - Interpretability: Each PC is linear combination of original dimensions

Configuration:
  - n_components: 2
  - Solver: SVD (default)
  - Random state: Not set (deterministic for this step)
  - Centering: Automatic (mean centering)

Process:
  1. Compute mean of all vectors
  2. Center data by subtracting mean
  3. Compute covariance matrix (384×384)
  4. Calculate top 2 eigenvectors
  5. Project all vectors onto these 2 eigenvectors
  6. Output: 2D coordinates for each paper

8.3 PCA PROJECTION RESULTS
------
Output:
  - Shape: (23,085, 2)
  - Data Type: float64
  - Coordinates: (PC1, PC2) for each paper
  - Range: Approximately [-10, 10] (depends on scaling)

Interpretation:
  - Horizontal Axis (PC1): Direction of maximum variance
  - Vertical Axis (PC2): Direction of 2nd maximum variance
  - Distance in 2D space: Approximates distance in 384D space
  - Clusters: Visible as distinct point clouds

Variance Explained:
  - PC1: ~15-20% of total variance
  - PC2: ~8-12% of total variance
  - Combined: ~25-30% of variance explained
  - Implication: 2D visualization loses ~70% detail but captures structure

8.5 VISUALIZATION INTERPRETATION
------
Quality Indicators from Plot:

✓ POSITIVE INDICATORS:
  - 12 distinct color groups visible
  - Minimal color mixing within clusters
  - Clear spatial separation between most clusters

  - Cluster 7 and others partially overlapping (2D limitation)

INSIGHTS FROM VISUALIZATION:
  1. Cluster 3 dominates: Large point cloud in specific region
  2. Cluster 1: Substantial presence across space
  3. Cluster 5 (Joints): Tightly localized cluster
